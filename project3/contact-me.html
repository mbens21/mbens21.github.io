            <div class="description-project">I am a Visual Communication Design major and Journalism minor at the University of Notre Dame. Through my classes and work at school, I have learned designâ€™s importance across all fields. From the colors chosen for food packaging to the configuration of an athlete and logos on a social media post, I enjoy conveying a story within each product. Storytelling is an essential element for successful work and connecting with people, and design is a powerful tool to aid in the delivery of any story. With my passion for storytelling and design, I aspire to work in the creative industry.
